<h1>The best movies according to Angela.</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Apocalypse Now</h3>

<p>One of the greatest movies out there according to critics and audiences. The movie took a few years and the general public was wondering why the movie was taking so long to complete. Francis Ford Coppola was a laughing stock becuase of the controversy surrounding the movie and the ambitious nature of the movie.</p>

<h3>The Departed</h3>

<p>A hardcore movie about the Irish mob in South Boston.
</p>

<h3>There Will be Blood</h3>

<p>Daniel Day Lewis kills it in this movie, full stop.</p>
